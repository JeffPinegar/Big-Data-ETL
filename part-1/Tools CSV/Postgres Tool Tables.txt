These files are the export of the tables from the Amazon

- Tools Product.csv
- Tools Customer.csv
- Tools Products.csv
- Tools Review ID table.csv

The data is from this location
url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Tools_v1_00.tsv.gz"

The data was cleaned and loaded into Postgres located on AWS RDS using:  part_one_tools.ipynb

I saved these files so I could attempt part two by loading these tables locally without using AWS RDS.
